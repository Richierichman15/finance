# ETF & Crypto Trading System Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

A stock tracking system was successfully modified to track ETFs and cryptocurrencies instead of individual stocks, with a sophisticated trading simulation implementing fundamental analysis-based decision making.

## Investment Universe

The system was configured to track 7 symbols:
- **ETFs**: SPY (S&P 500), XLE (Energy), GLD (Gold), QQQ (NASDAQ), VTI (Total Market)
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC-USD), XRP (XRP-USD)

## Technical Implementation

### Infrastructure Updates
- Modified `stock_data_collector.py` to track new symbols
- Added dependencies: `yfinance`, `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`
- Resolved Linux environment installation using `--break-system-packages`
- Created database initialization and table structures
- Built comprehensive `TradingSimulator` class

### Data Collection Success
Real-time market data successfully retrieved for all symbols:
- **SPY**: $593.05, P/E = 24.61
- **XLE**: $81.87, P/E = 14.60
- **GLD**: $309.33 (no P/E available)
- **QQQ**: $524.79, P/E = 30.74
- **VTI**: $291.72, P/E = 25.14
- **BTC-USD**: ~$101,300
- **XRP-USD**: ~$2.09

## Trading Algorithm

### Decision Criteria

**BUY Signals** (60% of criteria must be met):
- P/E ratio ≤ 25
- Free Cash Flow yield ≥ 5%
- Debt-to-Equity ratio ≤ 1.0
- Current ratio ≥ 1.2

**SELL Signals** (any single trigger):
- P/E ratio > 35
- Free Cash Flow < 3%
- Debt-to-Equity ratio > 1.5
- Current ratio < 1.0

**Position Sizing**: 15% of available cash per trade

## Simulation Results

### Initial Simulation ($5,000 Starting Balance)

**Successful Purchases:**
- SPY: $750.00
- XLE: $637.50
- BTC-USD: $541.88
- XRP-USD: $460.59

**Rejected Investments:**
- QQQ: P/E too high (30.74 > 25)
- VTI: P/E too high (25.14 > 25)
- GLD: No fundamental data available

**Outcome:**
- Total invested: $2,389.97
- Remaining cash: $2,610.03
- Total trades executed: 4

### 7-Day Backtest Performance (May 28 - June 5)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Final Portfolio Value**: $5,008.51
- **Total Return**: +$8.51 (+0.17%)
- **Peak Value**: $5,025.74 (+0.51%)
- **Strategy Effectiveness**: Maintained discipline, avoided overvalued assets

**Final Holdings:**
- SPY: 1.28 shares
- XLE: 7.81 shares
- Total trades over period: 2 (initial purchases only)
