system.start_monitoring(
    interval_minutes=5,      # Check every 5 minutes
    duration_hours=8         # Run for 8 hours
)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Safety First
1. **Always start with paper trading** - No real money until fully validated
2. **Monitor daily** - Check reports and alerts regularly
3. **Respect risk limits** - Don't override emergency stops
4. **Start small** - Use reduced capital for initial testing

### Transition to Live Trading
Only after **2-4 weeks** of successful paper trading:
1. Review all performance reports
2. Analyze risk management effectiveness
3. Confirm consistent profitability
4. Start with even smaller live capital ($1,000)
5. Gradually scale up if successful

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### If Emergency Stop Triggers
1. **DO NOT OVERRIDE** - Let the system protect capital
2. **Review logs** to understand what happened
3. **Analyze performance** data for issues
4. **Adjust strategy** if needed before restart

### If System Errors
1. Check `app/logs/live_trading.log` for details
2. Review `app/logs/alerts.log` for risk violations
3. Ensure market data connections are working
4. Restart with paper trading mode

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run quick test** (30 minutes) to validate setup
2. **Run full day test** (8 hours) to test complete cycle
3. **Analyze results** from logs and reports
4. **Continue paper trading** for 2-4 weeks
5. **Consider live deployment** only after proven success

**Remember: The goal is consistent, risk-managed returns, not quick profits!**
