‚úÖ **40% Max Position Size** (vs 25% in V3)  
‚úÖ **15% Portfolio Stop Loss** (vs 20% in V3)  
‚úÖ **25% Profit Taking** (vs 50% in V3)  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Feature Count Mismatch Error
**Problem**: Models trained with 39 features, predictions using 40 features
```
ERROR: X has 40 features, but StandardScaler is expecting 39 features
```
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent volume data availability across symbols
- Crypto symbols: Full volume data = 40 features
- Some stocks: Missing volume data = 39 features
- Training used mixed data, predictions failed on full-feature symbols

### 2. Fallback System Failure
**Problem**: AI fallback mechanism didn't trigger despite prediction failures
**Impact**: System held 100% cash for entire period (same as V3)

### 3. Data Inconsistency
**Problem**: Different symbols have different feature counts
**Solution Needed**: Feature standardization or symbol-specific models

## üìà AI Model Performance

### Training Results
```
‚úÖ Training Samples: 160 with 39 features
‚úÖ Model Accuracy: 71.9% (Excellent for financial predictions)
‚úÖ Training Success: XGBoost + Random Forest trained
‚úÖ Feature Engineering: Comprehensive technical indicators
```

### Prediction Capability

```

### Enhanced Fallback (V4.1)
```python
# Trigger fallback when AI confidence is 0
if not ai_working or max(confidences) == 0:
