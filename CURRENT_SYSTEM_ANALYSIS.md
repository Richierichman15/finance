## üí∞ **Real Money Implementation Guide**

### **üö® Critical Considerations Before Going Live**

#### **1. Regulatory & Legal**
- **Broker Selection**: Choose regulated broker (Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, etc.)
- **Tax Implications**: Understand short-term capital gains tax (up to 37%)
- **Compliance**: Ensure all trading activities comply with local regulations
- **Record Keeping**: Maintain detailed records for tax reporting

#### **2. Risk Management**
- **Start Small**: Begin with $1,000-$2,000, not $5,000
- **Position Limits**: Never risk more than 2% on a single trade
- **Stop Losses**: Implement hard stops at -5% portfolio level
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 6 months expenses separate from trading capital

#### **3. Technical Infrastructure**
- **Broker API**: Integrate with broker's API (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.)
- **Execution Speed**: Ensure low-latency execution for momentum strategies
- **Backup Systems**: Have redundant internet and power systems
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for system failures or large losses

### **üìã Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Paper Trading (2-4 weeks)**
1. **Fix Data Issues**: Resolve timezone and API problems
2. **Live Data Testing**: Test with real-time market data
